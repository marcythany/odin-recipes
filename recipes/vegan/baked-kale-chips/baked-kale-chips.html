				Imagine being able to munch as many crunchy snacks as you want while
				you're binging that show you love without feeling guilty later. That's
				the beauty of these homemade baked kale chips. Made by quickly tossing
				together three simple ingredients - fresh kale, olive oil, and flaked
				sea salt - and baked low and slow for only 20 minutes, these crispy kale
				chips are easy to make, there are no mystery additives, and even fussy
				eaters snap them up.
